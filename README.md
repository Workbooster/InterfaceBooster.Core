Interface Booster: Core
===================================

The Interface Booster Core contains the logic for executing interface definitions and Synery code.

## What does the Interface Booster do?

The Interface Booster is a software for fast developing stable and high quality interface applications which exchange business data between any applications, formats, files or services.

One of the big benefits of using Interface Booster is that the developer doesn't have to deal with the specifics of the foreign systems and formats. A Provider Plugin will do that for him.
